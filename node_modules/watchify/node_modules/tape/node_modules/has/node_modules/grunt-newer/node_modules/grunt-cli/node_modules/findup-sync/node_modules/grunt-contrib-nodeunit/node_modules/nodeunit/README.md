Nodeunit
========

Simple syntax, powerful tools. Nodeunit provides easy async unit testing for
node.js and the browser.

* Simple to use
* Just export the tests from a module
* Works with node.js and in the browser
* Helps you avoid common pitfalls when testing asynchronous code
* Easy to add test cases with setUp and tearDown functions if you wish
* Flexible reporters for custom output, built-in support for HTML and jUnit XML
* Allows the use of mocks and stubs

Usage
-----

Here is an example unit test module:

    exports.testSomething = function(test){
        test.expect(1);
        test.ok(true, "this assertion should pass");
        test.done();
    };

    exports.testSomethingElse = function(test){
        test.ok(false, "this assertion should fail");
        test.done();
    };

When run using the included test runner, this will output the following:

Installation
------------

There are two options for installing nodeunit:

1. Clone / download nodeunit from [github](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit),
   then:

    make && sudo make install

2. Install via npm:

    npm install nodeunit -g

API Documentation
-----------------

Nodeunit uses the functions available in the node.js
[assert module](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/assert.html):

* __ok(value, [message])__ - Tests if value is a true value.
* __equal(actual, expected, [message])__ - Tests shallow, coercive equality
  with the equal comparison operator ( == ).
* __notEqual(actual, expected, [message])__ - Tests shallow, coercive
  non-equality with the not equal comparison operator ( != ).
* __deepEqual(actual, expected, [message])__ - Tests for deep equality.
* __notDeepEqual(actual, expected, [message])__ - Tests for any deep
  inequality.
* __strictEqual(actual, expected, [message])__ - Tests strict equality, as
  determined by the strict equality operator ( === )
* __notStrictEqual(actual, expected, [message])__ - Tests strict non-equality,
  as determined by the strict not equal operator ( !== )
* __throws(block, [error], [message])__ - Expects block to throw an error.
* __doesNotThrow(block, [error], [message])__ - Expects block not to throw an
  error.
* __ifError(value)__ - Tests if value is not a false value, throws if it is a
  true value. Useful when testing the first argument, error in callbacks.

Nodeunit also provides the following functions within tests:

* __expect(amount)__ - Specify how many assertions are expected to run within a
  test. Very useful for ensuring that all your callback
