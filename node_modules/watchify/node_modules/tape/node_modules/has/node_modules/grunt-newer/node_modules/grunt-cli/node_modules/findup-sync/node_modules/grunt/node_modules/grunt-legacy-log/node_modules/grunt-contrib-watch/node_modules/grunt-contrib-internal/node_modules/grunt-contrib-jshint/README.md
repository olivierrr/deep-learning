# grunt-contrib-jshint v0.10.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint)

> Validate files with JSHint.



## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-jshint --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');
```




## Jshint task
_Run this task with the `grunt jshint` command._

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.

For more explanations of the lint errors JSHint will throw at you please visit [jslinterrors.com](http://jslinterrors.com/).

### Options

Any specified option will be passed through directly to [JSHint][], thus you can specify any option that JSHint supports. See the [JSHint documentation][] for a list of supported options.

[JSHint]: http://www.jshint.com/
[JSHint documentation]: http://www.jshint.com/docs/

A few additional options are supported:


#### globals

Type: `Object`  
Default: `null`

A map of global variables, with keys as names and a boolean value to determine if they are assignable. This is not a standard JSHint option, but is passed into the `JSHINT` function as its third argument. See the [JSHint documentation][] for more information.


#### jshintrc

Type: `String` or `true`  
Default: `null`

If set to `true`, no config will be sent to jshint and jshint will search for `.jshintrc` files relative to the files being linted.

If a filename is specified, options and globals defined therein will be used. The `jshintrc` file must be valid JSON and looks something like this:

```json
{
  "curly": true,
  "eqnull": true,
  "eqeqeq": true,
  "undef": true,
  "globals": {
    "jQuery": true
  }
}
```

*Be aware that `jshintrc` settings are not merged with your Grunt options.*


#### extensions

Type: `String`  
Default: `''`

A list of non-dot-js extensions to check.


#### ignores

Type: `Array`  
Default: `null`

A list of files and dirs to ignore. This will override your `.jshintig
