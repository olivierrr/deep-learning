# grunt-contrib-watch [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)

> Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted.



## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
```




## Watch task
_Run this task with the `grunt watch` command._


### Settings

There are a number of options available. Please review the [minimatch options here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options). As well as some additional options as follows:

#### files
Type: `String|Array`

This defines what file patterns this task will watch. Can be a string or an array of files and/or minimatch patterns.

#### tasks
Type: `String|Array`

This defines which tasks to run when a watched file event occurs.

#### options.interrupt
Type: `boolean`
Default: false

As files are modified this watch task will spawn tasks in child processes. The default behavior will only spawn a new child process per target when the previous process has finished. Set the `interrupt` option to true to terminate the previous process and spawn a new one upon later changes.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: ['jshint'],
    options: {
      interrupt: true
    }
  }
}
```

#### options.debounceDelay
Type: `Integer`
Default: 500

How long to wait before emitting events in succession for the same filepath and status. For example if your `Gruntf
