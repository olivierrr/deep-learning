/***********************************************************************

  A JavaScript tokenizer / parser / beautifier / compressor.

  This version is suitable for Node.js.  With minimal changes (the
  exports stuff) it should work on any JS platform.

  This file implements some AST processors.  They work on data built
  by parse-js.

  Exported functions:

    - ast_mangle(ast, options) -- mangles the variable/function names
      in the AST.  Returns an AST.

    - ast_squeeze(ast) -- employs various optimizations to make the
      final generated code even smaller.  Returns an AST.

    - gen_code(ast, options) -- generates JS code from the AST.  Pass
      true (or an object, see the code for some options) as second
      argument to get "pretty" (indented) code.
