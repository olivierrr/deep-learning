Install with:

    npm install redis

    npm install hiredis redis

If `hiredis` is installed, `node_redis` will use it by default.  Otherwise, a pure JavaScript parser will be used.

If you use `hiredis`, be sure to rebuild it whenever you upgrade your version of node.  There are mysterious failures that can
happen between node and native code modules after a node upgrade.

```js
    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

    // if you'd like to select database 3, instead of 0 (default), call
    // client.select(3, function() { /* ... */ });

    client.on("e
