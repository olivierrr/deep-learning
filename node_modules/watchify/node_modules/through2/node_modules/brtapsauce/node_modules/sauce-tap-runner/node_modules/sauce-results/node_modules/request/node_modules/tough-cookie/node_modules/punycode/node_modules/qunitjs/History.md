  * Show contents of text nodes in jsDump.node. Fixes #380.
  * Escape text. Fixes #379.
  * Rewrote most of the JUnitLogger addon as it was in bad shape: unused variables, duplicate effort that QUnit handles internally (e.g. tallying number of total assertions, failed assertions, etc.), sub-optimal XmlWriter implementation, etc.
  * Phantomjs: Include source in assertion details
  * Phantomjs: Removed the polling mechanism in favor of PhantomJS 1.6+'s `WebPage#onCallback`

  * Improve extractStacktrace() implementation. Fixes #254 - Include all relevant stack lines
  * Make filters case-insensitive. Partial fix for #252

  * Fix phantomjs addon header and add readme. Fixes #239
  * Add some hints to composite addon readme. Fixes #251

  * Cleanup composite addon: Use callback registration instead of overwriting them. Set the correct src on rerun link (and dblclick). Remove the composite test itself, as that was a crazy hack not worth maintaining
  * Cleanup reset() test and usage - run testDone callback first, to allow listeneres ignoring reset assertions
  * Double clicking on composite test rows opens individual test page
  * test-message for all message-bearing API reporting details

1.5.0 / 2012-04-04
==================

  * Modify "Running..." to display test name. Fixes #220

  * Add link to MDN about stack property

1.4.0 / 2012-03-10
==================

  * Prefix test-related session-storage items to make removal more specific. Fixes #213 - Keep hide-passed state when clearing session storage

  * Update package.json
  * Partially revert af27eae841c3e1c01c46de72d676f1047e1ee375 - can't move reset around, so also don't wrap in try-catch, as the result of that is effectively swallowed. Can't output the result as the outputting is already done.
  * Add QUnit.pushFailure to log error conditions like exceptions. Accepts stacktrace as second argument, allowing extraction with catched exceptions (useful even in Safari). Remove old fail() function that would just log to console, not useful anymore as regular test output is much more useful by now. Move up QUnit.reset() call to just make that another failed assertion. Used to not make a test fail. Fixes #210
  * Update equals and same deprecations to use QUnit.push to provide correct source lines. Fixes #211
  * Add a test file for narwhal integration. Has to use print instead of console.log. Fails when an assertion fails, something about setInterval...

  * Added initial version of a junitlogger addon.
  * Escape document.title before inserting into markup. Extends fix for #127
  * Catch assertions running outside of test() context, make sure source is provided even for ok(). Fixes #98
  * Improve global object access, based on comments for 1a9120651d5464773256d8a1f2cf2eabe38ea5b3
  * Clear all sessionStorage entries once all tests passed. Helps getting rid of items from renamed tests. Fixes #101
  * Set fixed dimensions for #qunit-fixture. Fixes #114
  * Extend nodejs test runner to check for stacktrace output, twice
  * Extend nodejs test runner to check for stacktrace output

  * Add a simple test file to check basic nodejs integration works
  * Check for global object to find setTimeout in node
  * Fix CommonJS export by assigning QUnit to module.exports.
  * Remove the testEnviromentArg to test(). Most obscure, never used anywhere. test() is still heavily overloaded with argument shifting, this makes it a little more sane. Fixes #172
  * Serialize expected and actual values only when test fails. Speeds up output of valid tests, especially for lots of large objects. Fixes #183
  * Fix sourceFromsTacktrace to get the right line in Firefox. Shift the 'error' line away in Chrome to get a match.
  * Fix references to test/deepEqual.js
  * In autorun mode, moduleDone is called without matching moduleStart. Fix issue #184
  * Fixture test: allow anything falsy in test as getAttribute in oldIE will return empty string instead of null. We don't really care.
  * Keep label and checkbox together ( http://i.imgur.com/5Wk3A.png )
  * Add readme for themes
  * Fix bad global in reset()
  * Some cleanup in theme addons
  * Update headers

  * Experiemental custom theme based on https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/62 by NV
  * Replace deprecated same and equals aliases with placeholders that just throw errors, providing a hint at what to use instead. Rename test file to match that.
  * Can't rely on outerHTML for Firefox < 11. Use cloneNode instead.
  * Merge remote branch 'conzett/master'
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Update sessionStorage support test to latest version from Modernizr, trying to setItem to avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_EXCEPTION
  * Change fixture reset behavior
  * Merge pull request #181 from simonz/development
  * Escaping test names

1.2.0 / 2011-11-24
==================

  * remove uses of equals(), as it's deprecated in favor of equal()
  * Code review of "Allow objects with no prototype to be tested against object literals."
  * Allow objects with no prototype to tested against object literals.
  * Fix IE8 "Member not found" error
  * Using node-qunit port, the start/stop function are not exposed so we need to prefix any call to them with 'QUnit'. Aka: start() -> QUnit.start()
  * Remove the 'let teardown clean up globals test' - IE<9 doesn't support (==buggy) deleting window properties, and that's not worth the trouble, as everything else passes just fine. Fixes #155
  * Fix globals in test.js, part 2
  * Fix globals in test.js. ?tell wwalser to use ?noglobals everyonce in a while
  * Extend readme regarding release process

1.1.0 / 2011-10-11
==================

  * Fixes #134 - Add a window.onerror handler. Makes uncaught errors actually fail the testsuite, instead of going by unnoticed.
  * Whitespace cleanup
  * Merge remote branch 'trevorparscal/master'
  * Fixed IE compatibility issues with using toString on NodeList objects, which in some browsers results in [object Object] rather than [object NodeList]. Now using duck typing for NodeList objects based on the presence of length, length being a number, presence of item method (which will be typeof string in IE and function in others, so we just check that it's not undefined) and that item(0) returns the same value as [0], unless it's empty, in which case item(0) will return 0, while [0] would return undefined. Tested in IE6, IE8, Firefox 6, Safari 5 and Chrome 16.
  * Update readme with basic notes on releases
  * More whitespace/parens cleanup
  * Check if setTimeout is available before trying to delay running the next task. Fixes #160
  * Whitespace/formatting fix, remove unnecessary parens
  * Use alias for Object.prototype.toString
  * Merge remote branch 'trevorparscal/master'
  * Merge remote branch 'wwalser/recursionBug'
  * Default 'expected' to null in asyncTest(), same as in test() itself.
  * Whitespace cleanup
  * Merge remote branch 'mmchaney/master'
  * Merge remote branch 'Krinkle/master'
  * Using === instead of ==
  * Added more strict array type detection for dump output, and allowed NodeList objects to be output as arrays
  * Fixes a bug where after an async test, assertions could move between test cases because of internal state (config.current) being incorrectly set
  * Simplified check for assertion count and adjusted whitespace
  * Redo of fixing issue #156 (Support Object.prototype extending environment). * QUnit.diff: Throws exception without this if Object.prototype is set (Property 'length' of undefined. Since Object.prototype.foo doesn't have a property 'rows') * QUnit.url: Without this fix, if Object.prototype.foo is set, the url will be set to ?foo=...&the=rest. * saveGlobals: Without this fix, whenever a member is added to Object.prototype, saveGlobals will think it was a global variable in this loop. --- This time using the call method instead of obj.hasOwnProperty(key), which may fail if the object has that as it's own property (touché!).
  * Handle expect(0) as expected, i.e. expect(0); ok(true, foo); will cause a test to fail
