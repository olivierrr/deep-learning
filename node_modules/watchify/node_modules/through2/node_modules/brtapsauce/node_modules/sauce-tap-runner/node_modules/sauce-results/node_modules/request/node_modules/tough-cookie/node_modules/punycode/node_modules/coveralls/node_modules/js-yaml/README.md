JS-YAML - YAML 1.2 parser and serializer for JavaScript
=======================================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml.png)](http://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml)

[Online Demo](http://nodeca.github.com/js-yaml/)


This is an implementation of [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human friendly data
